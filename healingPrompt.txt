# Fix Failing API Tests

The API tests in this project were passing before but are now failing due to API changes.

## Steps
1. Run tests to see failures: `yarn run runner`
2. Fetch current API spec: `npm run openapi:fetch-isSelect` (creates `openapi-isSelect.json`)
3. Compare spec with test expectations
4. Fix service files (`src/api/fakeApi/*.ts`) and test files (`fake-api-tests/*.spec.ts`)

## Project Structure
- Tests: `fake-api-tests/**/*.spec.ts` (Mocha/Chai)
- Services: `src/api/fakeApi/*.ts` (Axios HTTP clients)
- API spec: `openapi-isSelect.json`

Fix the tests to match the new API contract from the OpenAPI spec.
